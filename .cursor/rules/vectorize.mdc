We are seeking to avoid explicit and implicit python loops.
The exception will be cases where they are need to create generators (rare), for the orchestration of multiprocessing at different levels, and potentially for low cost user facing code.
This could be called a "no loops" rule, and I think I'd prefer that, but to be honest, it's just that I want to avoid Python loops.
If we have a list that we can slice intelligently, or break up and yield piece by piece this is great.
Looping scalarwise is a sign that we need to retool our data pipeline.
If we need to change our data pipeline, we have a lot of options.
